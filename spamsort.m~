function spamsort(mail_directory, spam_directory, ham_directory, dictionary_filename, spam_prior_probability) 

%SPAMSORT sorts email files into spam and ham (i.e., not spam).
%   The input mail_directory indicates file paths in which to look for 
%   ASCII text files. The dictionary_filename specifies where to find a
%   dictionary file. Using the information in the dictionary file, this
%   function moves all files from the mail directory into either the
%   spam_directory or the ham_directory, based on a naïve Bayesian
%   classifier.

    

    filename = strcat(mail_directory,mail_filename{i};
    movefile(filename,spam_directory)

end
